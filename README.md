# Introduction 

Good evening to the person reading this, this reposity will strictly be going over a small introduction to the perl programming language, how to get started with the language, and how it can still be used in todays world; without further to do lets hop into it. I will first strat this off by saying that perl is oftenly hated, very very oftenly hated due to its horrible write and syntax but as I have even seem people only hate on what they see up front, in order to clear that cloudy air up I will introduce you to the real perl, the perl people hate. 

# General information about the language 

To start off with perl is a general purpose, high level, object orriented programming language which was originally designed for network orriented / network basred applications that would need a fast and strong structure to it. Perl is not anymore a favorited language due to its weird and wacky syntax using things like `my` to define variables or `$$_` to define certian data and information. The language itself however outside of its very trashy syntax and quite weird and wacky format makes up when it comes down to developing applications that need a simple in and an advanced out, if you do not knpow what that means then you will learn it as we go on into this repo / post.


# What we will learn to do in this blog

In this repo I will be talking about general development with perl, mostly revolving around the command line / command line based applications. We will first start out by learning the basics of the language, features, variables, arrays, for, while, keys, subrotines, arguments, and more then move onto developing things like network utilities, http servers, system automation, and even simple shells / command line utilities. 


# 0x0001 -> learning your way around the language

Perl is a really all around language, it may look scary at first but I can promis you if you give the language about 3 weeks then you wiill get a pretty good hang of the language as it did myself. Getting into the language was hard yes I will admit that it often made me uncomfortable, however given my position I could not really leave it and practically depended on the language to support alot of my own personal servers and databases even my own network based applications
